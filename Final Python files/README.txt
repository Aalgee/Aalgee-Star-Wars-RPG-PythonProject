INSTRUCTIONS: This program is a tool that was created to help Game Masters 
	running the Star Wars: Force and Destiny roleplaying game to create new 
	adventures. It does this by randomly generating a list of enemies,
	locations, quest items, and motivations for the Game Master to incorporate 
	into their adventure. Of course before any adventure can be created there 
	needs to be at least one record in each of the six files used to store 
	Minions, Rivals, Nemeses, Locations, Quest Items, and Motivations. Enjoy!!!
	
NOTES: Dump files are created when records are deactivated.
