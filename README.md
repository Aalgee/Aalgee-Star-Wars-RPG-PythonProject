# Aalgee-Star-Wars-RPG-PythonProject
This is the first code project I ever completed. It was coded in python and it was blast to make. I learned a lot through this process and it has helped immensely since. 
This project acts as a way to store information about various aspects of the current Star Wars RPG, licensed by Fantasy Flight Games. The Crud functionality for various location types, enemies, and adventure motivations have been enabled. There is also funtionality for a random adventure generator that uses the information that is supplied to the program.
CSVs are used as the persistent data mechanism.
